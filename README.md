This application is used to form a connection between a packet sniffer application such as Wireshark
and an NXP Wireless 802.15.4 Microcontroller running NXP's sniffer firmware connected to a PC's serial port.

Packets received by the wireless microcontroller are encapsulated with a short header
in UDP datagrams and sent to a specified host IP address. 


The header appended to the 802.15.4 frame consists of the following:

Field Name      Length (octets)       Description
==========================================================================

Timestamp           5                           Timestamp generated by the JN51xx device
Sniffer Id          (Null terminated string)    A string identifier assigned to the sniffer
Channel             1                           The channel the message was received on
LQI                 1                           The received LQI
Length              1                           The length of the 802.15.4 frame


Appended to this is the 802.15.4 frame received from the JN51xx device.

If you would like to compile it yourself, it should build fine with the MinGW toolchain.
A pre built binary for Windows is included.

Using it:
Open a command prompt and type something like this:

JN51xx-802.15.4-Sniffer-Server.exe -s COM1 -c 14

This should start the sniffer server, connect to a JN51xx device running sniffer firmware on COM1 and begin sniffing on channel 14.

To get a list of the available options, type:

JN51xx-802.15.4-Sniffer-Server.exe -h  


Setting a wireshark capture filter such as "udp port 49999" will cut out all other traffic.
